       <p> Hello I’m Deborah, I’m studying App Development through the YearUP program. I’m a member of Coding Allies, a group that supports women minorities thrive in tech. I hope to incorporate my app development knowledge into User Experience and better understand the psychology of building a software.Anytime my non-english speaking mother and younger siblings upgrade their devices I'm the one to walk them through each functionality, translating what I knew in ways they could easily comprehend. In sixth grade I was given my very own laptop, one that  I could carry to my room and use. It was around then that I discovered tumblr. I started programming on the platform by editing my blog’s theme through HTML. I  edited themes to match my blog’s aesthetic as well as created my own using some CSS. The best part of learning HTML and CSS through Tumblr was how accessible my code was for others. There’s no limitation in coding besides my ability to think of logical solutions. The first project I help build, I pitched at a  hack-a-thon. We were given a three-month deadline to work with a group of people to work on a new app creation.  My pitch was a digital closet app that selects outfits for an individual based on the weather app called Outie. Building the application from an idea to reality gave me the same gratifications I got during my Tumblr days. I know my ability to collaborate would be an asset to any company I work for in the future. My journey with YearUp has enhanced my sharpness, professionalism, and confidence. So far, I’ve learned that app development is more social than technical. They say, “All it takes is an idea,” I would add “and a group of programmers” to that quote. We want to thank everyone here for supporting us year up students. Your investment in our future will make a huge impact in our lives. Goodnight.
